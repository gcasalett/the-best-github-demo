# Welcome to The Best GitHub Demo Ever!

## Fun things you can do from GitHub.com:

- Create your own branch (make sure your name is in the branch name somewhere)
- Add a new file to your branch
- Create a pull request to merge your changes into master

## Fun things you can do locally (a.k.a on your computer):

- Clone this repo
- Pull your branch down to your computer
- Checkout your branch
- Make some changes
- Push the changes from your computer to your branch in GitHub (`git push origin [your-branch]`)
